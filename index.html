	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>Hello, my name is Tri Ahmad Irfan. I’m a first year Computer Science student at University of Indonesia. I love programming and designing things. Sometimes I make websites and write anything I like. I know several programming languages and always eager to learn a new one.</p>
	<p>When I have leisure times, I’d love to grab a book and enjoy the moment out of it. I really appreciate a well-designed product. Someday, I want to be an IT-preneur, an inspiring writer, and a word class designer.</p>
	<p>Currently, I run a small web design studio named Coder Hutan Studio.</p>
